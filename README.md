Distributed Blockchain-Based Anonymous Mobile Electronic Voting System Using Facial Recognition
📌 Project Overview
Electronic voting has emerged as a modern alternative to traditional paper-based systems, offering the potential to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accessibility in democratic elections. Despite these benefits, electronic voting systems face significant challenges—chief among them being security, privacy, and trust.

This project introduces a distributed blockchain-based anonymous mobile electronic voting system that integrates facial recognition technology for secure voter authentication. The system is designed to be secure, efficient, scalable, and anonymous, addressing the key challenges of conventional e-voting mechanisms.

🔒 Key Features
🔗 Blockchain Integration
Ensures secure, immutable, and transparent storage of votes using a decentralized ledger. This prevents tampering or manipulation of voting records.

🧠 Facial Recognition Authentication
Authenticates eligible voters using facial recognition technology, preventing identity fraud while maintaining complete voter anonymity.

📱 Mobile Voting Platform
Provides a mobile-friendly interface, allowing users to securely cast their votes from smartphones.

🛡️ Voter Anonymity
Verifies identity without linking the vote to the voter, ensuring complete privacy and protection against coercion.

⚙️ Real-Time Processing with Python Backend
Built using Python to leverage real-time data handling, robust APIs, and integration with biometric and blockchain modules.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Backend: Python (Flask / Django)

Blockchain: Ethereum / Hyperledger / Custom Python Blockchain

Facial Recognition: OpenCV, Dlib, or FaceNet

Mobile App: React Native / Flutter

Database: IPFS / MongoDB / PostgreSQL

Security: End-to-end encryption, JWT for session management

🧪 How It Works
User Registration
Users register by submitting facial data and verifying identity via a trusted authority.

Voter Authentication
During elections, users authenticate via facial recognition to gain access to the voting system.

Anonymous Vote Casting
Votes are cast anonymously and recorded immutably on the blockchain.

Verification & Tallying
Votes are verified via blockchain consensus and tallied without exposing voter identities.

🎯 Objectives
Provide a secure, trustworthy, and tamper-proof digital voting platform.

Ensure voter anonymity while preventing electoral fraud.

Increase voter participation through mobile accessibility.

Demonstrate the real-world potential of blockchain and AI in civic technology.

📂 Future Enhancements
Multi-factor authentication with biometrics and OTP

Integration with government-issued digital identity systems

Deployment on permissioned blockchain networks for national scalability

Auditable trails for third-party verification
